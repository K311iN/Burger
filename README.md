This app uses Node.js, express, handlebars and mySQL to let you build and devour burgers.

Burgers that have not yet been devoured appear on the left and can be devoured by pushing the devour button. They then move to the right under Devoured.

Burgers can be added in the add burger box, which updates the mySQL burger database as yet to be devoured.
